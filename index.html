	      Advanced GTK+ Sequencer is intended to use for music composition. It features a piano roll, as well a synth, matrix editor, drum machine, soundfont2 player, mixer and an output panel.
	      It's designed to be highly configurable, you may add effects to its effect chain, add or remove audio channels/pads.
	      You may set up a fully functional network of engines, therefore exists a link editor for linking audio lines.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      In conjunction with ags you need a realtime kernel and alsa support. &grave;ags&grave; uses conditional locks to keep several threads in sync that's why you need at least a preemptible kernel.
