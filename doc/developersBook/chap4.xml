  <title>Port to safe read/write</title>
  <para>
    The AgsPort object may contain primitive types as well objects. The read/write operations are
    generally done by atomic operations. There exists interfacing AgsTaskThread functions but not
    used, for now.
    Representing objects should implement AgsPortletInterface.

      The AgsPortletInterface is used where a GObject is represented by the assigned port. The
      implemententing class is responsible for thread safe get/set properties. Most common way
      is using mutices.
